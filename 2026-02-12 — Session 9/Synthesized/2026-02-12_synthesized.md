### Players: Amerilynne, Orienne, Iskra, Fausto, Lautaro, Olaf, Lucien

---

## Opening Scene — Arrival

Fausto watches Amerilynne, Iskra, and Orienne arrive home. Amerilynne is talking about how she is being threatened. Fausto overhears that Amerilynne saw him passing notes to people and that she followed one of them to confront him — he ran away.

Iskra and Orienne notice Fausto but Amerilynne does not. Iskra makes a face at Fausto (indicating some concern) but he doesn't react outwardly.

Iskra whispers to Fausto that they need to meet later with Lautaro. Iskra tries to ditch Amerilynne and Orienne, but ends up having to make it explicit. All three head to their separate rooms.

## Orienne

Orienne is a Senior Financial Analyst. She returns to her room to find both a telegram from her boss **Antoine** and a separate note.

**Telegram (from Antoine):**
> I've been hearing excellent things from Doyle — he has praised you wonderfully. I promise you Senior Staff Financial Analyst once it's open, after 2–5 years.

**Note (from Matilda):**
> I've calculated the exact number. It's 43 million Pasarion — not worth shit in real money. Just a cool 8 million [Mk].

Orienne responds to Antoine, agreeing she has performed very well, and asks for **12 million Mk** for an investment opportunity.

## Amerilynne

Amerilynne also finds a telegram in her room, this one from **Jebenessence ("Jeb") Clawberger**, General Secretary of State Diplomacy for the Republic of Orlanda/New Arlandia:

**Telegram:**
> To my most trusted — When Annabelle doubted, I told her I knew you could procure it. Annabelle told me both were able to procure and return them with nary a whisper. Will help us be strong. We need strong allies — keep a lookout and pass them on.
>
> — Gen. Secretary of State Diplomacy for the Republic of Orlanda, Jebenessence Clawberger

The telegram speaks positively about her abilities and confirms she did a great job getting the guard schedule. She is directed to keep looking for people who will serve as positive allies for New Arlandia.

**Note:**
> To the honorable Amerilynne Swobach — I'm honored to take you up on your offer to meet tonight at 7pm.

Amerilynne is clearly pleased by Jeb's letter.

> **[Beth's note]:** Amerilynne masturbates to Jeb's telegram.

Also noted: boats were transporting **Donton** and **FCO notes/cash**. One boat is dropping a shipment at port — there is an address.

## Iskra

Iskra investigates the binder of shipping information she acquired. It contains almost entirely **Dolnton** and some **FCO cash**, along with an address for a **distribution center in Eau-Carte**.

She sets out to find Lautaro (and possibly Fausto).

---

## Lautaro ↔ Iskra

Lautaro heads to the courtyard, thinking about Graciana's earlier conversation — specifically how he might assemble a delegation (Fausto?) and who he might request from home (his sister?). His sister could fill that role if she has the support of their father.

Iskra finds Lautaro and wishes to discuss her findings from the morning:
- She shares the import logs and explains how they were acquired.
- She suspects that if anyone is blamed for the theft of the shipping documents, it would fall on **Amerilynne**.
- She wants to find a **lab for the purple residue sample**. Jaceledo doesn't have the best equipment/facilities, but has people who can start looking into it.
- Iskra suggests Lautaro **not mention any of this to the triumvirate**.
- Lautaro tells Iskra about his father's acknowledgement/knowledge of the mining and Dolnton. He is not concerned that his father is corrupt.

They go to find Fausto.

---

## Lautaro ↔ Iskra ↔ Fausto

- Iskra tells Fausto the gist of the Dolnton findings. She **does not** tell him about the distribution center address, nor the binder itself.
- Fausto informs them about his home and environmental concerns. He mentions being **20–30 miles from Checine** and that he has not been home since the war.
- Lautaro brings up the shipment details they have acquired.
- They debate: **investigate secretly or publicly?** It is noted that a public investigation would reflect poorly on Fausto.
- They plan to **visit the distribution center** as an initial investigation.

Lautaro asks Fausto how his day has been going.

## Olaf

Olaf leaves the basement and finds his way to **"The Closet"** — a bar. He holds a low opinion of Geraldo and believes censorship is bad, and that "this country will never get into the FCO." He notes that Anya is hard at work.

He comes upstairs and starts writing a **remediation report**, looking at a document pair that originates from **Gazpacho's department**. The document shows inventory before and after, with some items redacted:

| **Item** | **Before Amt** | **Location** | | **After Amt** | **Location** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Copper | 60g | 51'60" | | 60g | 51'60" |
| Latari | 20 lb | ? | | *(redacted)* | |
| Chlorine | 6 ton | Teleri/Taliri | | **100 lbs.** | Teleri/Taliri |
| Donton | 200 kg | Jaceledo | | 200 kg | Jaceledo |
| Latari-P1 | 50 kg | Teleri/Taliri | | *(redacted)* | |

> **Olaf's question:** "How do they track inventory? How do they know when to buy more of things?"

He starts to think about visiting the shipping yard, and decides he wants to ask **Fausto** what's going on. He goes to find him.

## Lucien

Lucien is in a carriage back to **San Segonia** with **Eriko**, feeling high off a recent win. He thinks about what to do with the information he got from the guard.

- He tells Eriko they seem to be well enough taken care of and doing fine.
- Eriko confirms that only he and his most trusted employees know the location, and that the guards are in his employ.
- Lucien asks if they are being moved often. **Eriko says no** — that's how the communists got the king: someone intercepted during one of the regular 3-week moves.
- Eriko says they won't need to be held much longer, as **the trial is coming soon**. He expects the outcome will be **exile**.
- Lucien tries to convince Eriko they should allow the prisoners to stay, liberated in their home country. Eriko rejects this.
- Eriko floats the idea of exiling the **Saquieros** to **Purstogne/Parson Freedom** — far away. Lucien is surprised, doesn't take it very seriously, and makes a joke about Eriko's suggestion that the mercantilist class would ever take over.

They arrive back at the Palace.

## Fausto

Eli approaches Fausto and requests he follow him. Two non-soldiers (plain clothes) accompany Eli. They go up to the **third floor**, where Eli instructs Fausto to wait outside the door — out of sight, not to be seen.

Eli's group knocks at **Amerilynne's door**. She greets them warmly; Amerilynne has two glasses of scotch waiting.

**The encounter:**
- Eli offers pleasant niceties and apologies: *"There are rumors, but we will do everything to handle it."*
- She is confused but welcomes them and offers scotch, seeking a more private discussion.
- Eli leads her to the window, then turns: **"You have not heard rumors? YOU. HAVE. STOLE. PRIVATE. DOCUMENTS."**
- He insinuates she is a spy, murderer, and traitor.
- Amerilynne tells the drunk guard story (she helped a guard who was too intoxicated — she stole nothing). Eli says he believes her.
- He then shows her a group of **8 men with rifles** below the window — a firing squad, who execute the guard she manipulated. Amerilynne is unmoved and slightly amused.

Amerilynne pivots immediately to business, channeling her favorite New Orlandia book: *"Dealing as an Art Form."*

**Her offer:**

| | Direction | Terms |
|---|---|---|
| Her vote | **FOR** | Control of Pasaro's mineral resources / unlimited rights to examine Pasarion minerals at any place, time, or quantity |

> "There are plenty of opportunities for mineral exploration in Pasoro — not unlimited, but we are open. Our sovereignty is paramount."
> Diego and I are both very open to it.

Amerilynne later reports back to **Jebenessence** that things are going well in terms of cultivating interests within leadership.
