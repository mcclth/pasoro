## ISKRA

- Investigates the binder of shipping info
  - Almost entirely dolnton & some FCO cash
  - Address of distrib. center in Eau-Carte
- Sets out to find Lautaro (and possibly Fausto)

---

## LAUTARO

- Heads to courtyard. Thinking about Graciana's chat, how he might go about getting a delegation put together (FAUSTO?) and who he might request sent here from home (sister?)
  - Sister could do that role if she has support of their father
- ISKRA finds LAUTARO & wishes to discuss some of her findings from the morning
  - Isk. discusses the import logs (& tells LAU. how it was acquired)
  - Isk. suspects — if anyone — the ship ppl would blame AMER. for the theft
  - Isk. wants to find a lab for the purple residue sample
  - JACELEDO doesn't have the best equipment/facilities, but certainly ppl that can start looking into it
  - They contemplate discussing this with FAUSTO
  - ISKRA suggests LAU. not mention this to any of the triumvirate
  - LAU tells Isk. about his father's acknowledgement/knowledge of the mining/dolnton
  - LAU is not concerned that his father is corrupt
- They go to find FAUSTO
  - ~ Isk. tells FAU. the gist of the dolnton findings
  - FAUSTO informs them about his home & env. concerns
  - LAU. brings up the shipment details they have acquired
  - Should we do this investigation secretly or publicly?
    - It would reflect poorly on FAUSTO to do this
- They plan to visit the distribution center as initial investigation

## OLAF

- Leaves the basement. Finds his way to "The Closet" — a bar
- Starts writing ~~[crossed out]~~ a remediation report
- Looks at the document pair *(Document originates from Gazpacho's department)*
  - Item | Amt | Location
  - Censored ~~[crossed out]~~ items
  - Litari — 20 lbs — "?"
  - Chlorine — 6 ton → 100 lbs — Taliri *(even in unredacted version)*
  - Dolnton — 200 kg — Jaceledo
  - Litari-P1 — [redacted] — Taliri
  - *Name & Amt redacted for these*
- "How do they track inventory? How do they know when to buy more of things?"
- Starts to think about visiting the shipping yard
- Decides he wants to ask FAUSTO wtf is going on

## LUCIEN

- In carriage back to SAN SEGONIA w/ Erico
- Thinking about what to do w/ the info he got from the guard
- Tells Erico they seem to be well-enough taken care of, doing well
- According to Erico, only he & his most trusted know this location, that the guards are in his employ
- Luc. asks if they're being moved often. Erico says that's how the communists got them — somebody intercepted during one of the 3-week moves
- Erico says they won't need to be held much longer. He expects them to be exiled
- Luc. tries to convince him they should allow them to stay, liberated in their home country
- Erico broaches the topic of exiling the Saquieros to Purstogne
  - Luc. is surprised, doesn't take it very seriously, and makes a joke at ERICO's suggestion that the mercantilist class would ever take over
- They arrive back @ the Palace

---

## FAUSTO

- Eli approaches & requests FAU follow him. He has 2 non-soldiers are w/ him
- Up to 3rd floor, requests FAU. wait outside the room. Do not be seen.
- The group approaches AMERILYNN's room & knock
- She greets ELI & welcomes the group into her room
- ELI: I wish to apologize. We have heard terrible rumors... we are working to fix the problem
- She is confused but offers him scotch nonetheless. She wishes to have a more private discussion
  - The rumors: You stole internal security docs. from our guard staff. This suggests she is a spy.
  - She insists she stole nothing, helped a guard who was too intoxicated
- AMER. notices a group ELI has effectively made her aware of — 8 men with rifles who fire on the guard she manipulated
- She is unmoved/amused & moves on to discuss the needs of New Arlandia
- "I … can guarantee [New Arl.] vote — but not for free"
- In exchange for my vote, we require N.A. has unlimited right to examine Pasoran minerals in any place/time/qty
  - "There are plenty of opportunities for mineral exploration in Pasoro." Diego & I both very open to it
- She later reports back to Jebanescence that things are going well getting interests within leadership
