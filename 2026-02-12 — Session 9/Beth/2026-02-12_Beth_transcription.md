## <u>Lucien</u>

- Feels high off a win.
- Talks to Eriko — says he thinks they are doing ok.
- Asks who knows where they are — Eriko says only him and his most trusted employees.
- Asks if they are being moved often?
  - **Eriko = No.** That's how the communists killed him (the king) while ~~to~~ they were being moved every 3 weeks.
- Eriko says they won't have to worry about it until too much longer.
- Because the trial is coming soon.
- Eriko hopes for "exile" while Lucien hopes for freedom (but Eriko rejects this).
- Eriko floats the idea of exile in Parson Freedom. But far away.

- Wait at the end of hallway.
- When the door closes, wait outside the door.

*Eli &* Two men knock at Amerilynne's door.
Amerilynne has 2 glasses of ~~con~~ scotch waiting.

- Eli tells her pleasant niceties and apologizes.
- "There are rumors but we will do everything to handle it."
- Leads her to window.
- "You have not heard rumors? YOU. HAVE. STOLE. PRIVATE. DOCUMENTS."
- He insinuates she is a spy, murderer, treasonous.

Amerilynne ~~hands~~ ~~with her documents~~ tells the drunk guard story.

Eli says he believes her.

But shows her the men in front of a firing squad below her window.

~~Remains~~ They get executed.
