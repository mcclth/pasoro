# 2026-02-12 — Session 9

## I. Amerilynn, Oriane, Iskra, Fausto

Fausto sees Amerilynn, Iskra, and Oriane arrive back at the palace, and overhears Amerilynn saying that she
- is being threatened
- saw Fausto passing a note to someone at dinner
- followed the recipient to confront him and he ran away

Iskra and Oriane notice Fausto, but Amerilynn does not.

Iskra makes a face at Fausto indicating some concern, but he doesn't confront the group in front of Amerilynn

Iskra indicates to Fausto that they need to meet later with Lautaro, and then tries to ditch Amerilynn and Oriane, but ends up having to make it explicit. All three head to their separate rooms.

## II. Oriane

Oriane is a Senior Financial Analyst.

Oriane returns to her room to find both a telegram from her boss **Antoine** and a separate note:

**Telegram (from Antoine):**
> I've been hearing excellent things from [Preston] Doyle — he has praised you wonderfully. I promise you Senior Staff Financial Analyst once it's open, after 2–5 years.

**Note (presumably from Matilda):**
> I've calculated the exact number. It's 43 million Pasoran — not worth shit in real money. Just a cool 8 million Mk.

Oriane responds to Antoine, agreeing she has performed very well, and asks for **12 million Mk** for an investment opportunity.

## III. Amerilynn

Amerilynn also finds a telegram in her room, this one from **Jebanescence**:

**Telegram:**
> To my most trusted —
> When Annabelle doubted, I told her I knew you could procure it. Annabelle told me you were able to procure and return them with nary a whisper. Will help us be strong.
> We need strong allies — keep a lookout and pass them on.
>
> — Gen. Secretary of State Diplomacy for the Republic of Arlandia, Jebanescence Clawberger

Additionally, she discovers a note which accepts a request to meet:

**Note:**
> To the honorable Amerilynn Silopache — I'm honored to take you up on your offer to meet tonight at 7pm.

Amerilynn masturbates in the afterglow of reading Jebanescence's telegram.

## IV. Iskra, Lautaro

Iskra investigates the binder of shipping information she acquired:
- shipment is **almost entirely dolnton**
- some **FCO marks**
- includes an address for a **distribution center in Eau-Carife**

She sets out to find Lautaro (and possibly Fausto).

Lautaro heads to the courtyard, thinking about Graciana's earlier conversation — specifically how he might assemble a delegation (Fausto?) and who he might request from home (his sister?). His sister could fill that role if she has the support of their father.

Iskra finds Lautaro and wishes to discuss her findings from the morning:
- She shares the import logs and explains how they were acquired.
- She suspects that if anyone is blamed for the theft of the shipping documents, it would fall on Amerilynn.
- She wants to **find a lab for the purple residue sample**. Jaceledo doesn't have the best equipment/facilities, but has people who can start looking into it.
- Iskra suggests Lautaro **not mention any of this to the triumvirate**.
- Lautaro tells Iskra about his father's acknowledgement/knowledge of the mining and dolnton. He is not concerned that his father is corrupt.

They go to find Fausto.

## V. Iskra, Lautaro, Fausto

Iskra tells Fausto the gist of the dolnton findings, but does not initially disclose the distribution center address, nor the binder & method of acquisition.

Fausto informs them about his home and environmental concerns
- He mentions his home of Cehine, being 20–30 miles from Jaceledo, suffered land degradation from environmental pollution due to mining further upland (in Jaceledo)
- He has not been home since before the war
- Is uncertain of the status of his family & home — has not heard from them in some time

Lautaro brings up the shipment details they have acquired, and they debate whether to investigate secretly or publicly. It is noted that a public investigation would reflect poorly on Fausto.

They **agree to visit the distribution center** as an initial investigation.

## VI. Olaf

Olaf leaves the basement and finds his way to "The Closet" — a bar.

He holds a low opinion of Geraldo and believes censorship is bad, and that "this country will never get into the FCO." He notes that Anya is hard at work.

He comes upstairs and starts writing a remediation report, and begins to assess the pair of original & censored documents he attained from Geraldo:
- originates from **Gazpacho's department**
- shows **inventory** before & after, with some **curious redactions**

#### Side-by-Side Comparison:
| **Item** | | **Orig Amt** | **Orig Location** | | **Edited Amt** | **Edited Location** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Copper* | | 60g | 51' 60" | | 60g | 51' 60" |
| Litari | | **20 lb** | "?" | | █████ | "?" |
| Chlorine | | **6 ton** | Taliri | | **100 lbs.** | Taliri |
| Dolnton | | 200 kg | Jaceledo | | 200 kg | Jaceledo |
| Litari-P1 | | **50 kg** | **Taliri** | | █████ | ██████ |
_*Uncertain whether entry for Copper is actually part of the document, or was simply an example given to describe the table layout before launching into it._

Olaf begins to wonder to himself, "How do they track inventory? How do they know when to buy more of things?"

He starts to think about visiting the shipping yard, and decides he wants to ask Fausto what's going on. He goes to find him.

## VII. Lucien

Lucien is in a carriage back to San Segonia with Erico, feeling high off his recent win, thinking about what to do with the information he got from the guard.

- He tells Erico they seem to be well enough taken care of and doing fine.
- Erico confirms that only he and his most trusted employees know the location, and that the guards are in his employ.
- Lucien asks if they are being moved often
  - Erico says no — that's how the communists got the king: _someone intercepted during one of the regular 3-week moves._
- Erico says they won't need to be held much longer, as **the trial is coming soon**. He expects the outcome will be **exile**.
- Lucien tries to convince Erico they should allow the prisoners to stay, liberated in their home country. Erico rejects this.
- Erico floats the idea of exiling the Saquieros to **Purstogne** — far away. Lucien is surprised, doesn't take it very seriously, and makes a joke about Erico's suggestion that the mercantilist class would ever take over.

They arrive back at the Palace.

## VIII. Fausto, Amerilynn

Eli approaches Fausto and requests he follow him. Two non-soldiers (plain clothes) accompany Eli. They go up to the **third floor**, where Eli instructs Fausto to wait outside the door — out of sight, not to be seen.

Eli's group knocks at the door and **Amerilynn** greets them warmly; Amerilynn has two glasses of scotch waiting.

**The encounter:**
- Eli offers pleasant niceties and apologies: *"There are rumors, but we will do everything to handle it."*
- She is confused but welcomes them and offers scotch, seeking a more private discussion.
- Eli leads her to the window, then turns: **"You have not heard rumors? YOU. HAVE. STOLEN. PRIVATE. DOCUMENTS."**
- He insinuates she is a spy, murderer, and traitor.
- Amerilynn tells the drunk guard story (that she helped a guard who was too intoxicated — she stole nothing). Eli says he believes her.
- He then shows her a group of **8 men with rifles** below the window — a firing squad, **who execute the guard** she manipulated.
  - Amerilynn is unmoved and slightly amused.

Amerilynn pivots immediately to business, channeling her favorite New Arlandian book, *"Dealing as an Art Form."*:

**Amerilynn's offer to Eli:**
> Her vote, for:
> - Control of Pasoro's mineral resources
> - unlimited rights to examine Pasoran minerals
>   - at any place
>   - at any time
>   - in any quantity

**Eli's response**
> There are plenty of opportunities for mineral exploration in Pasoro — not unlimited, but we are open. Our sovereignty is paramount.
> Diego and I are both very open to it.

Amerilynn later reports back to Jebanescence that things are going well in terms of cultivating interests within leadership.
