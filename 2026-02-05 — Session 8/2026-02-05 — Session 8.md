---

## I. ISKRA, AMERILYNN, & ORIANE

- Amerilynn and Oriane arrive at the piazza/The People's Library and find Iskra in a debate with Octavio

- Octavio is attempting to push socialist literature on Iskra as though she's a naive newcomer to these ideas

- Amerilynn rushes in, asks if Iskra is okay and whether Octavio is bothering her

- Iskra is fine dealing with him. She continues trying to extract useful information from Octavio, asking about the purple magic residue and any associated literature

- Iskra asks Octavio for ANY real information
	- She finds an archive book: _On the History of Warfare_
	- Indicates she will take it

- Upon ending the conversation, Iskra turns to speak with Amerilynn and Oriane

- Amerilynn asks if Iskra is armed
	- Iskra is not and does not wish to be

- Iskra asks Amerilynn if she wants to go to the port; she agrees

- Oriane knows the port is known by the nickname of "Little Purstogne"

- The three head to the nearby port of Eau-Carife

- They walk 30-40 minutes to the port
	- Mostly small sailing boats with some steam boats
	- The steamers at the far end (Dauschtam ships) are busy and efficient
	- The more numerous sailing vessels are less industrious—sailors on break, smoking tarbash, loitering, etc.

- An old, unshaven man ogles Amerilynn. When she inquires what his deal is, he makes it clear he is attracted and desires to take her out (while ignoring Oriane completely)

- Amerilynn tries to get information about mining out of him, but he'll say nothing without money for it

- Amerilynn's offer: $20 up front, then $20 more if the info is good

- Man gets excited, agrees, takes the $20, and flees, leaving Amerilynn with $970

- Amerilynn brandishes her pistol, but Oriane restrains her

- Oriane gets the sense something is wrong here (in the port, Eau-Carife), but knows not what

- Iskra approaches a local sailor on a wooden boat, asking what he knows about the Dauschtam ships and their cargo
	- Sailor: "Don't come near my ship, don't file your paperwork, don't do anything... Dauschtam are awful people"

- Iskra asks what they are transporting
	- Sailor only knows it is steel drums

- Iskra and the other two move on to the steam ships

- Steam ships worked by fast, efficient, serious workers

- Iskra uses native language greeting:, "_Bahigo_!"

- Worker is sealed-lips due to regulation

- Iskra references FCO status

- Worker: "Pulling rank is the most just 'action.'"

- Worker cooperates with vague affirmations
	- Worker: "Here, we bring them the tools of economic development"

- Iskra turns to Amerilynn and requests her to provide a distraction while she tries to look at cargo/shipping info

- Iskra sees labeled drums and a cargo manifest and references this to Amerilynn, passing the information to her

- Amerilynn begins speaking to Captain **"Franz"** who propositions her to a "date"... where she pays but he brings the wine

- While Amerilynn talks to Franz, Iskra successfully nabs a binder with shipping documentation

- Amerilynn tries to get more information from Franz but FAILS—their distraction is too transparent and their attempted entry is noticed

- Oriane realizes no one at the port is a Purstogner

## II. LUCIEN

- Lucien is picked up in a blacked-out, horse-drawn carriage to travel to the estate where the remaining members of the royal family are being held in isolation

- Attendant/emissary of Erico arrives to retrieve Lucien and ushers him into the blacked-out carriage
	- Erico and two of his men are present in the carriage
	- They travel for approximately 1 hour

- Lucien is led out of the carriage by an attendant into a densely forested grove that anonymizes the area, up to an isolated estate

- Erico says they are trying to keep the royal family comfortable, unlike other less-civilized nations that have ousted royal leadership

- Lucien can hear sounds of children playing nearby

**Martín:**
- Man with long, curly gray hair
- Sitting in a tall rocking chair (throne-like)
- "So it is you who will be determining our fate with the international monitors. It is nice to meet you."
- Complains that the conditions are unacceptable

**Lucien:**
- The conditions appear to be what they would be for a minor lord
- Assures Martín his #1 goal is to secure the royal family's wellbeing
- Says he thinks they can do a bit better

**Martín**, in an angry outburst:
> "This is a disgrace."
> "They think the revolution 'matters'"
> "FCO wants to shove us aside? It's not about conditions—there are supporters everywhere"
> "YOUR FAMILY WILL BE NEXT"
> "Tell them, the situation is unstable"
> "YOUR FAMILIES WILL BE SERVANTS OF THE MERCHANT CLASS"
> "Tell the FCOs to deal with us"
> "Don't cut deals with Christavo!"

**Lucien:**
- Humors Martín, and more than that, almost commits to his cause
- Conveys Diego's message to Martín
- [17 on DC15] communicates an honest (if limited) concern/sympathy

**Martín:**
- "He [Diego] is such a self-righteous prick..." and dismisses Lucien

**Lucien:**
- Leaves Martín to walk the house and grounds, inspecting the rest of the property. Observations:
	- 7-8 guards with swords and pistols
	- Not super well protected, if anyone knew where they were
- Approaches a guard and gives a customary _'Guasillme'_ [greeting in Purstogne]. She does not understand him
	- Tries to get information on the location from the Purstogner stationed on site
	- Doesn't go well initially, so he attempts to bribe her with 300 FCO marks (of the 5,000 he has on his person)
	- Guard gestures for more money, and upon his new offer of 600 marks becomes much more forthcoming:

**Guard provides several details:**
- Royal family has been held for **17 months**, including other locations/houses before moving to this secluded estate
- This location is some **20-30 miles due west of San Segonia**
- The estate is **owned by the Núñez family**. This is one of their unoccupied homes
- Trial is scheduled for **3 weeks out** (in San Segonia)
- **The royal family has not been told when the trial is scheduled**
- No plans to move them before their trial

## III. LAUTARO

- Lautaro happens upon Graciana (at a bar?) and approaches, sits next to her to converse

**Lautaro:**
- Despite how productive things have been so far, "I am needed at home. For a couple of days... this is what I want to do."
- "I need to intervene at home before the things I'm concerned over get out of hand."

**Graciana:**
- First taken aback, then annoyed. Seems to feel Lautaro's concern is immature and that he is failing to acknowledge their bigger-picture issues

**Lautaro:**
- Feels undercut, lacking the power/authority to operate as a decision-maker here

**Graciana:**
- Contrasts Lautaro's position with the truly powerless/voiceless role of Arianna
- Is most concerned that above all else, it's imperative that Jaceledo secure a seat at the table
- Implies the best course may be for Lautaro to get a delegation including himself sent to Jaceledo, during which time he might also deal with his concerns there
- Is headed to Taliri with the stated task of "cleaning-up a mess..." She is clearly stressed out about it

**Lautaro:**
- Offers some activities to join him on to ease her mind, but is gently turned down

**Graciana:**
> "Why are those demons in our country? We just took control... Surely, we can do better."
> **"Lautaro, I'm telling you: you may have misgivings, but... _get them to agree_."**

## IV. OLAF

- In the basement, Anya is looking at data. Olaf is doing cable management/tracing

- People bring hard data → processed → satellites → to other countries (dishes)

- Olaf has started trying to assess the physical flow of information to/from the palace

- _[NAT 20]_ Wandering the basement, having become annoyed tracing cables, Olaf hears a whirring sound emanating from a room

- He opens the door and enters to find a balding man with papers printing and flying about

**Bald man:** "Hello sir... You're not supposed to be here."

- Olaf introduces himself as an FCO delegate

- The bald man seems to have no idea what the FCO even is

Bald man introduces himself as **Geraldo Guevara, Data Quality Manager**

- Geraldo: "Gazpacho didn't mention [that any such person would be around]"

- Geraldo is the entire quality team—the only person in charge of data quality

- Olaf asks him about Gazpacho

- Geraldo says Gazpacho is nice, but doesn't fully trust him
	- He's from Vallozi, which seceded from Pasoro approximately 80 years ago
	- Geraldo is a traditionalist/conservative/... boomer
	- He complains about the younger generation

- Olaf and Geraldo commiserate over their work ethic vs. the lacking efforts of others

- Geraldo indicates he finds Gazpacho to be somewhat ineffectual—Gazpacho makes only _some_ deadlines, misses meetings

- Geraldo notes that there are rumors about Gazpacho and Mrs. Marcone (!)

**But how is Geraldo's work vetted?**

- Olaf states his mission: FCO needs to have quality data to exchange

- Olaf tries to impress upon Geraldo what he needs to achieve in order to endorse FCO admittance, and notes that Gazpacho is quite an impediment in this regard

- Geraldo assures: quality is there, 100%
	- Claims that he singularly confirms the accuracy of every message/all data

- Olaf says he's been cross-checking... [soft threat]

- Geraldo seems completely out of his depth when Olaf starts to inquire about details of this process

- Geraldo: "I have been making ALL the corrections"

- They dig into this a bit, and it becomes clear that any "correction" Geraldo makes is based not on knowledge/deduction, rather instructions given directly on the documents to redact portions

- Olaf deceptively asks for an example of a pre-corrected transmission, gives a comprehensive justification

- Geraldo reluctantly hands over a pair: an original record and its "corrected" version

- Olaf inquires about **the 'man who brings the boxes'** that Geraldo has mentioned
	- **He'll be here tomorrow** (approximately noon)
	- Geraldo invites Olaf to return at that time

- Olaf invites Geraldo to bar time tonight

- Geraldo accepts the invitation

**Olaf inspects the documents on his way up:**
- They are inventory documents
- He is not familiar with their content

## V. FAUSTO

- Leaves Eli's office

- Primary concern: ensuring FCO members are around or determining where they have gone

- Asking around where Amerilynn has gone to
	- Guard says she flew out of there ("possible schizophrenic")

- Fausto looks around the city for breakfast spots they may have stopped at. No luck

- Goes back to palace entrance and watches for comings and goings

**Observations:**

_Morning surveillance:_
- **Gazpacho** in formal wear, heading back to the palace/office
- **Ursula Marcone** (Tiago's wife) closely tails Gazpacho
	- She is dressed in a similar fashion. They appear to have been somewhere together

_Lunchtime—Fausto enters the palace to observe anyone congregating/speaking therein:_
- **Christavo** and **Iria** speaking together
	> Iria: "That boy of yours [Erico] is going to fuck everything up for us."
	> Christavo: "Not now; I don't have time for your factionalism."
- **Eli** is present, but nothing specific noticed

- **Enzo**
	- Shows up and has an exchange with Christavo
	- Iria's friend (possibly her _only_ friend)
	- Leader of Vallozi's revolutionary paramilitary force. Their troops came to assist in Pasoro during the recent civil war
	- Enzo and Iria are both from Vallozi

- **Preston Doyle** is also present, talking/speaking a bit with them/the triumvirate
- **Preston Jr.?** — Doyle is accompanied by a young man, potentially his son

_Afternoon—Fausto returns to post in view of main entrance to continue surveilling for Amerilynn in particular:_

- **Iskra**, **Amerilynn**, and **Oriane** eventually return together
	- Amerilynn voices her concerns that people are exchanging notes and plotting to assassinate her/them
	- Amerilynn mentions to Iskra their plan to meet with Lucien in an attempt to acquire funding to arm themselves
