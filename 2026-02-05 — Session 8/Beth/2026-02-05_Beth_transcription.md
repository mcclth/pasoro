# Beth's Notes - 05 Feb 2026

## Page 1 (Page 65)

Amerilynne and Orienne come upon the People's Library and see ISKRA who's talking to Octavio

- Amerilynne rushes in, asks if she's okay

- ISKRA tells her about the port

- Orienne = knows that the port is known as 'Little Prestone'

- ISKRA asks Octavio again for ANY info, real info
  → ISKRA fins an archive, on History of Warfare

- ISKRA asks Amerilynne if she wants to go to the port, she agrees

- They walk 30-40 minutes...
  mostly small boats some steam boats

- ISKRA is looking for Dolton shipments looking for Jaceledans...
  notices ships from Daushton

- Amerilynne looks for outsiders

- old, unshaven man asks for money, Amerilynne lies and says no
  he insinuates. Orienne is also poor

- They start making a money/info deal

---

## Page 2 (Page 66)

Amerilynne's offer:
- $20 now
- $20 if the info is good

Man gets excited, agrees, takes the money, and RUNS

Amerilynne pulls a gun, Oriene tries to stop her, she ultimately does not go offensive

Orieenne gets the sense something is wrong

ISKRA approaches wooden boat asks about steam ships

"Don't come near my ship, don't file your paperwork, don't do anything... Dausheton are awful people"

ISKRA asks what they are transporting
→ only knows it is steel drums

ISKRA + 2 others move on to steam ships

steam ships worked by fast, efficient, serious workers. ISKRA uses native language greeting: Bahigo!

---

## Page 3 (Page 67)

Worker is sealed lips, due to regulation

ISKRA references FCO status

worker: "Pulling rank is the most just 'action.'"

Worker cooperates with vague affirmations

ISKRA sees information (labeled drums, cargo manifest) and references this to Amerilynne
... passes to her

Amerilynne talks to Worker (Franz) while ISKRA successfully nabs a binder

Franz propositions Amerilynne, she tries to get more = FAILS

Orienne realizes no one is a Prestoner

---

**Lucien**

Picked up in horse and carriage

Eriko and a couple of his guys are in there, shades are all drawn

An hour ride... at least

---

## Page 4 (Page 68)

Leaves cover everything; difficult to tell where they are

Eriko says they are trying to keep (the royal family) comfortable can hear sounds of children playing

**Martin** man with long, curly gray hair
→ sitting in tall rocking chair
Is "It's you determining our fate... with international monitors"

Lucien assures him his #1 goal is to secure well being

Martin says the conditions are unacceptable

To Lucien → conditions are what they would be for a minor lord

Lucien says he thinks they can do a bit better

Martin angrily outbursts →

"§ This is a disgrace. They think
§ the revolution 'matters'
§ FCO wants to shove us aside?
§ It's not about conditions
§ theres supporters everywhere

---

## Page 5 (Page 69)

§ YOUR FAMILY WILL BE NEXT
§ Tell them, the situation
§ is unstable
§ YOUR FAMILIES WILL BE SERVANTS
§ OF THE MERCHANT CLASS
§ Tell the FCOs to deal with
§ us, don't cut deals with
§ Christavo!"

Lucien humors him → more than that, almost commits to his cause

Lucien tells Martin, Diego's message
... Martin responds that he's
"such a self-righteous prick"
and dismisses Lucien

Lucien observes other details

7-8 guards with swords, pistols
Not super well protected, if anyone knew where they were

Lucien goes up to guard → gets a tight
"Bvasill(me"
(thank you in French)

Guard does not understand
Asks her where they are
→ "¿" Woods

---

## Page 6 (Page 70)

Have a guarded conversation
She's not giving up a ton

Lucien has cash, pulls out 300 'marks'

"Are they mobile. Where did they come from, and how long?"

Guard motions for more

$600 ⇓

## Page 7 (Page 71-72) - BLANK PAGE WITH HEADING

**OLAF**

Basement

Anya looking at data
Olaf doing cable management

People bring hard data → processed → satellites → to other countries (dishes)

Olaf trying to find where data is coming in → starts wondering
Hears whirring
open door!

Balding man. Papers printing and flying. Hello? Not supposed to be there

---

## Page 8 (Page 72)

Olaf intros self as FCO

Bad man = Haraldo Guevera

TITLE: Data Quality Manager

He's the entire quality team

Olaf asks about GAZ:

Heraldo says he's nice, doesn't fully trust him...
He's from Valitzi who was once independent from Pasorca...
complains about the younger generation

Gazpacho makes some deadlines, misses meetings, rumors about him and Mrs. Maronie (!)

But now is work vetted?

Olaf states mission →
FCO needs to have quality data to exchange

Heraldo assures = quality is there
100%

Olaf says he's been cross checking... soft threat

Heraldo = I have been making ALL the corrections

---

## Page 9 (Page 73)

They dig into this =

corrections are black outs of data
censor bars

Olaf asks for example of pre-corrected transmission, gives a comprehensive ~~TRANSMISSION~~ justification

Heraldo reluctantly hands over uncorrected and corrected record

Olaf inquires about MAN WHO BRINGS BOXES
(he'll be here tomorrow)

Olaf invites Heraldo to bar time tonight

---

**FAUSTO**

leaves Eli's office

Primary concern → ensuring members are around

Asking around where Amerilynne has gone to

Guard says she flew out of there (possible schizophrenic)

---

## Page 10 (Page 74)

Fausto looks around city for breakfast spots, they may have stopped at

No luck

Goes back to palace entrance and watches for comings and goings

Observes:

~ Gazpacho heading back to office, trailed by woman in party wear

Woman = Ursula Maronie, Tiago's wife

Rotates around entrances, tells guards he's looking for Amerilynn

Looks for Triumverate
- Christavo
- Iria (Eriho, probably)

Iria is complaining about "a boy" but Christavo tells her to leave it

Sees Iria's friend Enzo, he has exchange with Christavo

---

## Page 11 (Page 75)

Enzo = leader of paramilitary in Valutzi who came over to help
Allied with Iria

Preston Doyle is also talking to them, with his kid potentially

Fausto posts back up at entrance

Amerilynne, Orienne, ISKRA come back
