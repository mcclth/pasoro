# 2026-02-05 — Session 8

## Iskra, Amerilynn, & Oriane
Amerilynn and Oriane come upon the People's Library and see Iskra who's talking to Octavio

- Amerilynn rushes in, asks if she's okay

- Iskra tells her about the port

- Oriane = knows that the port is known as 'Little Purstogne'

- Iskra asks Octavio again for ANY info, real info
  → Iskra finds an archive, 'On the History of Warfare'

- Iskra asks Amerilynn if she wants to go to the port, she agrees

- They walk 30-40 minutes...
  mostly small boats some steam boats

- Iskra is looking for Dolton shipments looking for Jaceledans...
  notices ships from Dauschtam

- Amerilynn looks for outsiders

- old, unshaven man asks for money, Amerilynn lies and says no
  he insinuates. Oriane is also poor

- They start making a money/info deal

Amerilynn's offer:
- $20 now
- $20 if the info is good

Man gets excited, agrees, takes the money, and RUNS

Amerilynn pulls a gun, Oriane tries to stop her, she ultimately does not go offensive

Oriane gets the sense something is wrong

Iskra approaches wooden boat asks about steam ships

"Don't come near my ship, don't file your paperwork, don't do anything... Dauschtam are awful people"

Iskra asks what they are transporting
→ only knows it is steel drums

Iskra + 2 others move on to steam ships

steam ships worked by fast, efficient, serious workers. Iskra uses native language greeting: Bahigo!

Worker is sealed lips, due to regulation

Iskra references FCO status

worker: "Pulling rank is the most just 'action.'"

Worker cooperates with vague affirmations

Iskra sees information (labeled drums, cargo manifest) and references this to Amerilynn
... passes to her

Amerilynn talks to Worker (Franz) while Iskra successfully nabs a binder

Franz propositions Amerilynn, she tries to get more = FAILS

Oriane realizes no one is a Purstogner

## Lucien

Picked up in horse and carriage

Erico and a couple of his guys are in there, shades are all drawn

An hour ride... at least

Leaves obscure everything; difficult to tell where they are

Erico says they are trying to keep (the royal family) comfortable can hear sounds of children playing

**Martín** man with long, curly gray hair
→ sitting in tall rocking chair
Is "It's you determining our fate... with international monitors"

Lucien assures him his #1 goal is to secure well being

Martín says the conditions are unacceptable

To Lucien → conditions are what they would be for a minor lord

Lucien says he thinks they can do a bit better

Martín angrily outbursts →
> This is a disgrace.
> They think the revolution 'matters'
> FCO wants to shove us aside? It's not about conditions theres supporters everywhere
> YOUR FAMILY WILL BE NEXT
> Tell them, the situation is unstable
> YOUR FAMILIES WILL BE SERVANTS OF THE MERCHANT CLASS
> Tell the FCOs to deal with us
> "Don't cut deals with Christavo!"

Lucien humors him → more than that, almost commits to his cause

Lucien tells Martín, Diego's message
... Martín responds that he's "such a self-righteous prick" and dismisses Lucien

Lucien observes other details
- 7-8 guards with swords, pistols
- Not super well protected, if anyone knew where they were

Lucien goes up to guard → gives a customary "Guasillme" [greeting in Purstognian]. She does not understand him

He asks her where they are → "Woods"

Have a guarded conversation. She's not giving up a ton

Lucien has cash, pulls out 300 marks

"Are they mobile. Where did they come from, and how long?"

Guard gestures for more money. He offers 600 marks and receives several details:
- they've been held for 7 months, including other locations/houses before moving to this secluded estate
- this location is due west of San Segonia, about 20-30 miles
- 'owned' by Núñez family. This is one of their unoccupied homes
- Trial is scheduled for 3 weeks out (in San Segonia)
- The royal family has not been told when the trial is scheduled

## Lautaro

Lautaro speaks with Graciana about his concerns & requests to return home to Jaceledo

## OLAF

In basement, Anya looking at data. Olaf is doing cable management / tracing

People bring hard data → processed → satellites → to other countries (dishes)

Olaf trying to find where data is coming in → starts wandering and hears a whirring sound emanating from a room.

He opens the door and enters to find a balding man, papers printing and flying about.
Man: "Hello? You're not supposed to be here!"

Olaf introduces himself as an FCO delegate

Bald man introduces himself as **Geraldo Guevera**, Data Quality Manager

He's the entire quality team

Olaf asks him about Gazpacho
Geraldo says he's nice, doesn't fully trust him...
He's from Vallozi, which was once part of the same country as Pasoro...
He complains about the younger generation

Geraldo notes that Gazpacho makes only _some_ deadlines, misses meetings, and that there are rumors about him and Mrs. Marcone (!)

But how is Geraldo's work vetted?

Olaf states his mission → FCO needs to have quality data to exchange

Geraldo assures = quality is there, 100%

Olaf says he's been cross checking... soft threat

Geraldo: I have been making ALL the corrections

They dig into this a bit, and it becomes clear that to the "corrections" are just portions of the documents that Geraldo is instructed to redact

Olaf asks for example of pre-corrected transmission, gives a comprehensive justification

Geraldo reluctantly hands over a pair of an original record & its "corrected" version

Olaf inquires about **the 'man who brings the boxes'** that Geraldo has mentioned  → **he'll be here tomorrow**

Olaf invites Geraldo to bar time tonight

## FAUSTO

Leaves Eli's office

Primary concern → ensuring FCO members are around or determining where they have gone

Asking around where Amerilynn has gone to

Guard says she flew out of there ("possible schizophrenic")

Fausto looks around city for breakfast spots, they may have stopped at. No luck

Goes back to palace entrance and watches for comings and goings

Observations:
- Gazpacho heading back to office, trailed soon after by woman in similar dress
	- Woman = Ursula Marcone, Tiago's wife
- _[Rotates around palace entrances, tells guards he's looking for Amerilynn]_
- Looks for Triumvirate, sees Christavo & Iria
	- Iria is complaining about "a boy" [Erico, probably] but Christavo tells her to leave it
- Iria's friend Enzo approaches them and has an exchange with Christavo
	 - **Enzo** = leader of paramilitary in Vallozi. Their troops came over to help during recent war
- Preston Doyle is also talking to them, with a young man [potentially his son]
- _[Returns to post in view of main entrance to continue surveilling for Amerilynn in particular]_
- Amerilynn, Oriane, Iskra returning together
