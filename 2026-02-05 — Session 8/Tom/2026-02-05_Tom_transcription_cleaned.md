# 2026-02-05 — Session 8

## ISKRA, AMERILYNN, & ORIANE

- Arrive @ the piazza/The People's Library & run into Iskra arguing with Octavio

- Octavio is trying to push some literature on Iskra as though she's a naive newcomer to socialist ideas

- Amerilynn asks if Octavio is bothering Iskra, but Iskra is fine dealing w/ him. She continues trying to get info of any use out of him. Asks about the purple magic residue & any assoc. literature.

- She finds a book on the history of ___(?) and indicates she will take it

- Upon ending the convo, she turns to speak with Amerilynn & Oriane

- Amerilynn asks if Iskra is armed

- Iskra is not & does not wish to be

- The three head to "Little Purstogne", the nearby port of Eau-Carife

- The steamers at the far end of the port (Dauschtam ships) are busy, efficient. The more numerous sailing vessels are less industrious — sailors on break, smoking tarbash, loitering, etc.

- An unshaven? man ogles Amerilynn. When she inquires what his deal is, he makes it clear he is attracted & desires to take her out (while ignoring Oriane completely)

- Amerilynn tries to get info about mining out of him, but he'll say nothing without $$$ for it

- She offers $20 up front + $20 after, and he agrees, takes the $20, and flees

- Amerilynn brandishes her gun but is restrained by Oriane

- Amerilynn is down to $970

- Oriane senses something is wrong here (in the port, Eau-Carife), but knows not what

- Iskra approaches a local sailor asking what he knows about the Dauschtam ships, their cargo

- She receives little info. Heads directly to the ships instead. Amerilynn & Oriane follow in tow

- Iskra stops @ the first steamer that is loading/unloading steel drums among their cargo & asks what they are handling
	> Here, we bring them the tools of economic development

- Iskra turns to Amerilynn & request her to provide a distraction while she tries to look at cargo/shipping info
	- Amerilynn begins speaking to Cpt. "Franz" who propositions her to a date... where she pays but he brings the wine
	- They fail to acquire the documentation as their distraction is too transparent and their attempted entry is noticed

## LUCIEN

Lucien is picked up to travel to the estate where the remaining members of the royal family are being held in isolation
- Attendant/emissary of Erico arrives to retrieve Lucien & ushers him into a blacked-out, horse-drawn carriage
	- Erico and two of his men are present in the carriage
	- They travel for approx. 1 hr
- Lucien is led out of carriage by an attendant into a densely forested grove that anonymizes the area, up to an isolated estate

**Erico:**
> - "we try to keep them comfortable" unlike other less-civilized nations that have ousted royal leadership

Lucien can hear children playing nearby.
An aging but well-built man sits on a throne of a chair:

**Martín:**
> "so it is you who will be determining our fate w/ the international monitors. It is nice to meet you."
> - He complains of the conditions in which they are being kept; noble-to-noble...
> - Assures Lucien that the people would rise up if they knew how "badly" they are held

**Lucien:**
> Sympathizes. Is concerned w/ the isolated nature of the estate

**Martín:**
> - Speaks of concern that this sort of coup could happen anywhere (incl. Purstogne) if a message that this is unacceptable isn't sent, Lucien's family — _all_ royals, in fact — will eventually fall (indeed, quite soon)
> - "A message?! We have our own messengers..."
> - "Do not cut deals w/ Christavo!"

**Lucien:**
> - [17 on DC15] conveys an honest [if limited] concern/sympathy
> - relays Diego's message
>   - Martín replies disdainfully, "He is such a self-righteous prick..."
> - Leaves Martín to walk the house & grounds. Inspects the rest of the property.
> - Tries to get info on the location from a Purstogner stationed on site.
>   - Doesn't go well initially, so he opts to bribe her instead
>   - He has 5,000 FCO marks on his person & offers 300 to the guard
>   - She indicates ↑ more money, and upon being offered 600 marks, is much more forthcoming

**Guard:**
> - Captured 17 months ago
> - Not their first safe-house
> - Location of this estate is approximately 20 miles due west of San Segonia
> - The estate is owned by the Núñez family
> - No plans to move them before their trial
> - Trial is in 3 weeks, but the royal family has been kept from this info

## LAUTARO

- Happens upon Graciana (at a bar?) and approaches, sits next to her to converse

**Lautaro:**
> - Despite how productive things have been so far; "I am needed at home. For a couple of days... this is what I want to do."
> - Graciana seems taken aback by this request
> - Lautaro indicates the need to intervene at home before the things he's concerned over get out of hand

**Graciana:**
> -  Annoyed. Seems to feel Lautaro's concern is immature and fails to acknowledge their bigger-picture issues

**Lautaro:**
> - States he feels undercut here — that he lacks the power & authority to operate as a decision-maker here

**Graciana:**
> - Contrasts Lautaro's position with the truly powerless/voiceless role of Arianna
> - Is most concerned that above all else, it's imperative that Jaceledo secure a seat at the table.
> - Implies the best course may be for Lautaro to get a delegation incl. himself sent to Jaceledo, during which time he might also deal with his concerns there
> - Is headed to Taliri with the the stated task of "cleaning-up a mess..." She is clearly stressed out about it

**Lautaro:**
> - Offers some activities to join him on to ease her mind, but is gently turned down

**Graciana:**
> -  "Why are those demons in our country? We just took control... Surely, we can do better."
> - **"Lautaro, I'm telling you: you may have misgivings, but... _get them to agree_."**


## OLAF

- Olaf has started trying to assess the physical flow of info to/from the palace

- _[NAT 20]_ Wandering the basement, having become annoyed tracing cables, he hears a noise & enters the room from which it emanates

- Bald man: "Hello sir... You're not supposed to be here."

- Olaf introduces himself as an FCO delegate. The bald man seems to have no idea what the FCO even is...

- Bald man introduces himself as Geraldo Guevara, Data Quality Manager

- Geraldo: "Gazpacho didn't mention [that any such person would be around]"

- Geraldo is the only person in charge of data quality. He doesn't trust Gazpacho because he is from Vallozi (which seceded from Pasoro ≈ 80 years ago)

- Geraldo is a traditionalist / conservative / ... boomer

- Olaf & Geraldo commiserate over their work ethic vs. the lacking efforts of others

- Geraldo indicates he finds Gazpacho to be somewhat ineffectual, misses deadlines and meetings, and also mentions that there are rumors about Gazpacho & Mrs. Marcone...

- Olaf tries to impress upon Geraldo what he needs to achieve in order to endorse FCO admittance, and notes that Gazpacho is quite an impediment in this regard

- Geraldo claims that he singularly confirms the accuracy of ...every message / all data, but seems completely out of his depth when Olaf starts to inquire about details of this process

- Any "correction" Geraldo makes is based not on knowledge/deduction, rather instructions given directly on the documents to redact portions

- Olaf deceptively tries to acquire a primary, non-redacted document, and successfully acquires a pair of "corrected" & original document

- The "man who delivers the boxes" will be here ≈noon tomorrow. Geraldo invites Olaf to come back by at that time.

- Olaf also invites Geraldo to come join at the bar after work

- Olaf inspects the documents on his way up and finds:
  - They are inventory documents
  - He is not familiar with their content

## FAUSTO

Having failed to find where Amerilynn may have headed to, Fausto returns to the palace and posts up outside, in view of the main entrance to observe people coming & going:
- **Gazpacho** in formal wear, returns to the palace
- **Ursula Marcone** Tiago's wife, closely tails Gazpacho. She is dressed in a similar fashion. They appear to have gone somewhere together.

At lunchtime, Fausto enters the palace to observe anyone congregating / speaking therein
- **Christavo** & **Iria** speaking together
	- Iria: "That boy of yours [Erico] is going to fuck everything up for us."
	- Christavo: "Not now; I don't have time for your factionalism."
- **Eli** is present, but nothing specific noticed
- **Enzo**
	- Friend/ally of Iria shows up
	- Maybe her _only_ friend
	- Enzo has an exchange with Christavo
	- Iria and Enzo are both from Vallozi
	- Enzo is the leader of Vallozi's revolutionary paramilitary force which joined the war in Pasoro
- **Preston Doyle** is present, speaking a bit with the triumvirate.
- **Doyle Jr.?** Preston is accompanied by somebody, perhaps his son

Fausto returns to his exterior post following lunch:
- **Iskra**, **Amerilynn**, and **Oriane** eventually return together
	- Amerilynn mentions her concerns that people are exchanging notes & plotting to assassinate her/them
	- Amerilynn mentions to Iskra their plan to meet with Lucien in an attempt to acquire funding to arm themselves
