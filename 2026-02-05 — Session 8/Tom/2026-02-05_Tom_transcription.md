# Session 8 - 2026-02-05

## ORIANE & AMERILYNN

- Arrive @ the piazza/The People's Library & run into ISKRA arguing with OCTAVIO

- OCT is trying to push some literature on ISKRA as though she's a naive newcomer to socialist ideas

- AMER. asks if OCT. is bothering ISKRA, but ISKRA is fine dealing w/ him. She continues trying to get info of any use out of him. Asks about the purple magic residue & any assoc. literature.

- She finds a book on ___? and indicates she will take it

- Upon ending the convo, she turns to speak w/ AMER. & ORI.

- AMER. asks if ISK. is armed

- ISK. is not & does not wish to be

- They 3 head to "Little Perstone", the nearby port

- The steamers @ port are busy efficient (Dauschtam ships) while the more numerous sailing vessels are less industrious

- An unshaven? man stares @ AMER.. When she inquires what his deal is, he makes it clear he is attracted; tries to take her out (ignores ORI.)

- AMER. tries to get info about mining out of him & he basically says give $$$ for it

- She offers $20 up front $20 after & he agrees, takes the $20, and flees. AMER. brandishes her gun but is restrained by ORI.

- AMER. is down to $970

- ORI. observes: something is wrong here (in the port, EAU-CARIFE), but knows not what

- ISK. approaches a local sailor asking what he knows about the Dauschtam ships, their cargo

- She receives little info. Heads directly to the ships instead. AMER. & ORI. follow in tow

- ISK. stops @ the first steamer that is loading/unloading steel drums among their cargo & asks what they are handling
  ~ "here, we bring them the tools of economic development"

- ISK. turns to AMER. & request her to provide a distraction while she tries to look at cargo/shipping info
  ~ AMER. begins speaking to Cpt. "Franz" who propositions her to a date... where she pays but he brings the wine

## LUCIEN

- Attendant/emissary of Erico arrives to retrieve LUC. & commute in a blacked-out carriage.

- ERI. & 2 of his men are present

- Approx. 1 hr travel

- Led out of carriage by an attendant into a densely forested grove that anonymizes the area, to an isolated estate

- ERI.: "we try to keep them comfort" unlike the less civilized other commies

- LUC. can hear children playing nearby. An aging but well-built man sits on a throne of a chair

**MARTIN:**
- "so it is you who will be determining our fate w/ the just'l mautros, it is nice to meet you."

- He complains of the conditions in which they are being kept; noble-to-noble...

- & assures LUC. that the people would rise up if they knew how "badly" they are held

- LUC. sympathizes. Is concerned w/ the isolated nature of the estate

- MARTIN speaks of concern that this sort of coup could happen anywhere (incl. Perstone) if a message that this is unacceptable isn't sent, Luc's family—all royals—will eventually fall (indeed, quite soon)

- MART. "A message?! We have our own mssgrss... Do not cut deals w/ Christavo"

- PAT. rolls 17 on PC15 to convey an honest [if limited] concern/sympathy

- LUC. relays DIEGO's msg & MART. replies [disdainfully] "He is such a self-righteous prick..."

- LUC. leaves him & walks/inspects the rest of the property

---

- LUC. tries to get info on the location from a Perstoner stationed on site. Doesn't go well initially, so he opts to bribe her instead

- He has 5,000 Erco "marks" on his person & offers Mk 300

- She indicates ↑ more money

- 17mo. ago: Not their 1st safehouse

- Are Due W of SANSEGONTA (~20 mi)

- Old manor owned by NUNES family

- No plans to move them b/f trial

- 3 wks to trial, but the family has been kept from this info

---

## LAUTARO

- Happens upon GRACIANA @ bar?& approaches/sits to converse

- LAU.: "despite how productive things have been so far; 'I am needed @ home. For a couple of days... this is what I want to do.'"

- GRA. seems taken aback by this request, but LAU. indicates the need to intervene @ home before the things he's concerned over get out of hand.

- GRA. seems annoyed at this special/showy/fake/immature concern of LAU

- LAU feels he lacks power/authority to operate as a decision-maker in this context.

- GRA. contrasts LAU's position with the truly powerless/voiceless role of ARIANNA. Is most concerned that above all else, it's imperative that Jaceledo secure a seat at the table.

- GRA. implies the best course may be to try getting a delegation/envoy to go to Jaceledo & deal w/ it by being a part of this envoy

- GRA. is headed to Taliri w/ the stated task of "cleaning-up a mess..." She is stressed out about it.

- LAU. offers some activities to join him on to ease her mind

- GRA: "Why are those demons in our country? We just took control... Surely, we can do better."

- GRA: "LAU. I'm telling you: you may have misgivings, but... get them to agree"

## OLAF

- Olaf has started trying to assess the physical flow of info to/from the palace

- [NAT 20?] Wandering the basement, having become annoyed tracing cables.

- he hears a noise & enters the room from which it emanates,

- bald man: "Hello sir... You're not supposed to be here."

- OLAF intro's self. as FCO delegate - bald man has no idea what FCO is.

- Bald man = GERALDO GUEVEIRA
  Title: Data Quality Manager

- GER: "GAZPACHO didn't mention" [that any such person would be around]

- GER. is the only person in charge of this. He doesn't trust GAZ. b/c he is from VALUEZI (which seceded from PASORO ≈ 80 yrs ago)

- GER. is a traditionalist, a conser-vative, a...boomer.

- OLAF & GER. sympathize on work ethic.

- GER. finds GAZ. to be somewhat ineffectual, and also mentions that there are rumors about GAZ & Mrs. MARCONE...

- OLAF tries to impress upon GER. what he needs to achieve in order to endorse FCO admittance & notes that GAZ is quite an impediment in this regard

- GER. claims he singularly confirms the accuracy of ...every msg/all data, but seems lost when OLAF starts to go in-depth abt it.

- Any "correction" GER. makes is based on, not knowledge/deduction, but just instructions given directly on the documents

- It becomes clear that for GER., "corrections" are just redactions.

- OLAF deceptively tries to acquire a primary, non-redacted document

---

and successfully acquires a pair of "corrected" & original document

- The "man who delivers the boxes" will be here ≈noon tomorrow. GER. invites OLAF to come by.

- OLAF also invites GER. to come join @ the bar after work

- OLAF inspects the documents on his way up to find:
  - they are inventory documents
  - OLAF is not familiar w/ their content

---

## FAUSTO

- GAZ headed back to office closely tailed by a similarly well-dressed woman —URSULA MARCONE, TIAGO's wife

- LUNCHTIME: CHRISTAVO & IRIYA

- IRIYA: "That boy of yours [IERICO] is going to fuck everything up for us."

- CHRISTAVO: "Not now; I don't have time for your factionalism."

---

See ELI: (What's _____?)

---

IRIYA's friend ENZO shows up, maybe her only friend. he has an exchange w/ CHRIST. & him have an from VALUEZI, both IRZ & ENZ

ENZO is leader of rev. para-military that joined the war in Pasoro

PRESTON DOYLE & somebody, perhaps his son, are around, conversing loosely w/ the triumvirate.

After lunch, AMER. + ORI. + ISK. approach the palace.

- AMER. mentions her concerns that ppl are exchanging notes & plotting to assassinate her/them.

- AMER. mentions the plan to meet w/ Luc. to get funding for arming themselves
